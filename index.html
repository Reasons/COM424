            <h4>COM - 424: Document Design</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Here is the starting point of the online portfolio for COM 424: Document Design for the Fall 2016 Semester.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this portfolio, you will find the various exercises that were completed in this class. There are many different principles of design that were explored and I hope that you, the reader, enjoy the process that I went through.</p>
            <p>Starting out, we had to trace a letterform, three variants of the letter "A", in Adobe Garamond Pro font.</p>
            <p>The second exercise had us modifying the various text properties, such as line spacing, rotation, and scale for a word to help give meaning to that word.</p>
            <p>Third, We were tasked to design a layout for a paragraph of text in order to give it meaning.</p>
            <p>Fourth, we explore the different types of basic shapes, the point, line, and plane.</p>
            <p>Fifth, we look at Symmetry and Asymmetry and it's importance.</p>
            <p>Sixth, we look at Scale, how size really does matter.</p>
            <p>Seventh, we look at Texture, an important part of objects.</p>
            <p>Eighth, we look at Color, and it's importance in making things stick out</p>
            <p>Ninth, we take a look at Figure/Ground relationships and how focus can really make a difference.</p>
